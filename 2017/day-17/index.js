   * faster. Of course, this implies that following all numbers is more difficult. Fortunately, we only need to
   * know what's the value just after zero and we know where zero is from the start. Having heavily abused
   * `console.log` to print the first element in the buffer for a few thousands of times and some additional
   * trial-and-error, I can say it is always at the first position... 😌
