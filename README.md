# Advent of Code 2017

## What?
A collection of solutions for the challenges of [AoC 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017). Starting from the first of December all the way to Christmas ðŸŽ„, every day a challenge is posted at Advent of Code.

## Why?
Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯ For the lulz and to keep sharp of course! ðŸ’©

## How?
As my solutions are written in JavaScript, you can run them by using `node`. At least, that's what I do. Just do something like ```node day-1``` and you're good to go! ðŸ˜‰
