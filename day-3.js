   * Map the input number to the next perfect odd square and calculate the steps to the center from
   * there. E.g., numbers 1 to 9 map to 9 as perfect odd square, numbers 9 to 25 map to 25, etc.
   * Walking from the perfect odd square to the center is the "worst case scenario", so the amount of steps
   * is ought to be lower than that. Therefore, calculate the amount of steps from the odd square to the actual
   * input number, knowing that the length of the sides is the square root of the odd square, and subtract
   * this from the amount of steps to the center you calculated before.
   * And then, well, pray and hope for the best! 🙏🏻
